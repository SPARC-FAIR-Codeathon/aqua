# :chart_with_upwards_trend: Analysis of the existing SPARC search portal

**1. Limited search feature of the SPARC Portal:** It does not recognize nearby words (in case of **typos**). As an example, if we type "rattis" (typo) instead of "rattus", it does not recognize it or give any suggestion (Fig 1).
<br/>

  <i>Fig 1. Search results for a typo (rattis) on the SPARC portal. </i>
</p>
  
   <br/>
   
**2. Vague result display:** You need to enter the exact correct keywords in the search bar (Fig 2) and yet, it does not **bold/highlight the search keywords** among the search results.

  <i>Fig 2. Search results for a correct keyword (rattis) on the SPARC portal. Keywords are not bolded/highlighted in the results.</i>
</p>
   
**3. Limited result filterings:** The website currently refines the results by either being "Public" or "Embargoed" (Fig 3).

**4. Limited result sorting:** The website currently sorts the results by either "Title" (listed alphabetically) or "Published date" (Fig 3).

  <i>Fig 3. Limited filterings for the results display on the SPARC portal.</i>
</p>
   <br/>
   
**5. No option for Email alerts :** In the event of No results being found for the queries, there is no way for the user to get informed on whether a **new dataset/resource** (related to their query) has been published on the SPARC portal or not.
<br/>

# :bulb: AQUA objectives for the new SPARC search portal
Specific features of AQUA are listed below:
<br/>
* :point_right: __Query refinement__
   * Auto-completion:<br/>
      Based on the term, our tool automatically completes the queries if it partially/completely matches any keywords. It then sends the selected keyword to AQUA backend.
   * Suggestion:<br/>
      If no exact matches are found, it finds close-matches and suggests them to the user with popping up the phrase: *"Did you mean ...?"*. Otherwise, it will send the raw and uncorrected query to AQUA backend.

* :point_right: __Results filtering__
   * Sort by:<br/>
      When the results for the query are displayed, user will have the option of sorting them based on the *Relevance*, *Date published*, and *Alphabetical order*.
    * Filter by:<br/>
      The results can also be filtered based on *Keyword*, *Author*, *Category*, and *Publication date*.
    * Matched text bolded/highlighted
    
    
* :point_right: __Alert me about future datasets related to search query__

     At the end, if no results are returned by the AQUA backend, our tool asks the user if they want to get notified when a related resource is published or not. For a given email address, the tool checks for its validity and then stores it using SQLite. Thereafter, it will check for any updated/uploaded related resource on the SPARC portal everyday at 2AM EDT. In case of the requested resource availability, it sends a notification email to the registered user.

# :iphone: AQUA Components
The AQUA application integrates Python libraries, data mining tools, a SQL database engine, and Document Object Model (DOM) API to mimic an environment similar to the SPARC search portal with an improved functionality in multiple ways. In general, the AQUA platform consists of a presentation layer as the User Interface (UI) (referred to as frontend) and a server-side data-access layer (referred to as backend). The **AQUA UI** and the **AQUA Backend** bridge between the user and the Knowledge Management Core (K-Core) database. K-Core is the SPARC knowledge graph database.


## 1. AQUA Backend

The AQUA backend includes querying the K-Core database for information, delivering data to the frontend, and processing any logic that the AQUA UI requires. The main tools utilised for the AQUA Backend are Python (Jupyter Lab), Docker, SQLite, and SciGraph.
<br/>
The AQUA backend focuses on two main features:
<br/>

:sparkles: __Behind the scenes of AQUA's Query refinement__ 

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/aqua/blob/main/src/assets/images/Suggestion_AutoComplete.jpg" alt="interface" width="780" height="700"></br>
  <i>Fig 5. Query refinement by Auto-completion/Suggestions.</i>
</p>
<br/>

AQUA utilises SciGraph for auto-completion and suggestion. However, we found that SciGraphâ€™s suggestions do not deal with query problems such as error spelling and continuous script (*scriptio continua*). Therefore, we have added a new auto-correction feature to segment queries with missing spaces and fix error spelling by creating a pipeline to [SymSpellPy](https://pypi.org/project/symspellpy/). The auto-correction result is combined with the suggestion results and then executed as the final query search terms.

<br/>
<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/aqua/blob/main/src/assets/images/NotifyMe.jpeg" alt="interface" width="780" height="500"></br>
  <i>Fig 6. "Notify me" module.</i>
</p>
 <br/>
The "Notify Me" option is to send emails that summarize search results against exact keywords. "Notify Me" module sends the email just once at least one exact hitting match exists. Therefore, "Notify Me" can be used for:<br/>
<br/>

1.	Notify users when a dataset gets published against keywords that do not retrieve any results yet.
2.	Emailing the current search results in a tabular format, which can be found helpful for users.
Additionally, the "Notify Me" module stores all requests in an SQLite database, which the SPARC team can further analyze to understand the search pattern and get more insights on demand. For example, the SPARC team can find the most common keywords searched with no existing matches and decide to fulfil such needs. 

(To read more, please visit: ["Notify me" Readme](https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/aqua/tree/main/Documentation/NotifyMe.md))
<br/>

## 2. AQUA UI
<br/>

AQUA UI receives the user's queries, formulates them, and transfers to the AQUA Backend module. When the response from the AQUA backend is received, the AQUA UI interprets it and displays the content on the screen. Like the SPARC portal web application, the AQUA UI is implemented by the HTML-CSS-JS trio using: [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/). Nuxt.js is an upper-level framework that is built over Vue.js to design and create highly advanced web applications [[1](https://cubettech.com/resources/blog/nuxt-js-and-vue-js-reasons-why-they-differ-and-when-do-they-combine/)].

# :information_desk_person: How to use AQUA? 

How to use the 7 features added to the existing SPARC Portal Search engine by AQUA:

#### 1. Predictive search typing
AQUA provides autocompletion for user's query as they type. This feature is powered by training data from the NIF Ontologies and Scigraph. To avoid too many results being returned that can slow down the application, we only show autocompletion after users type 3 letters and more. (Figure 7)

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/aqua/raw/main/src/assets/images/UI-autocompletion.png" alt="interface" width="850" height="580"></br>
  <i>Fig 7. Predictive typing interface.</i>
</p>

#### 2. Advanced search options

There are currently 2 options for user's search query: "Exact match" or "Any of the words match". The default is "Any of the words match". If users want to return datasets for their exact search phrase, they can do that by clicking on "Advanced search" under the search box (Figure 8).

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/aqua/raw/main/src/assets/images/advanced-search.png" alt="interface" width="850" height="500"></br>
  <i>Fig 8. Advanced search interface.</i>
</p>

#### 3. Advanced Sorting
The existing SPARC Portal allows sorting based on dataset titles (alphabetically) and by published date. AQUA adds a "Relevance" sorting criterion that returns results based on how relevant the results are to their search query. This is set as the default sorting option (Figure 9).

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/aqua/raw/main/src/assets/images/UI-sorting.png" alt="interface" width="700" height="500"></br>
  <i>Fig 9. Advanced sorting interface.</i>
</p>

#### 4. Advanced Filtering
The existing SPARC Portal only allows for filtering based on "Dataset status", which is either Published or Embargoed. Aqua adds more sophisticated filtering options: by "Published Date", "Keyword", "Author", and "Category". Users can filter datasets by one or several keywords, authors, and categories. Hit "Enter" after each "keyword", "author", or "category" in their respective box to register it. After the entries are registered, click "Apply" to filter dataset results (Filter 10).

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/aqua/raw/main/src/assets/images/UI-filtering-feature.png" alt="interface" width="740" height="500"></br>
  <i>Fig 10. Advanced filtering interface.</i>
</p>

#### 5. Email notifications for new matched datasets
Users can opt in to receive emails about new datasets that match their search query. AQUA believes this is a much needed option for users to stay updated about their search and SPARC datasets. Simply click on "Create alerts" under the search box and enter an email. AQUA will trigger an email send when newly added dataset(s) that match the search query are published by SPARC. This is a one-time only email subscription. Options to be alerted more than once can be added in the future. (Figure 11)

<p align="center">

  <i>Fig 11. Email Notification interface.</i>
</p>

#### 6. Bold matched texts in result display
When a dataset is returned, any matched text in the dataset title and description will be bolded for easy and convenient lookup (Figure 12). 

<p align="center">

  <i>Fig 12. Bolded matched text in result display.</i>
</p>

#### 7. View type
AQUA adds view type to the existing SPARC Portal to enhance user experience with the website. The default option is List view, which is the SPARC Portal's existing view type. AQUA proposes to add a gallery view option in the future. (Figure 13)

<p align="center">

**Step 2**: Go into the `aqua` directory and run the following commands:
```
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

# :mag_right: Testing

:point_right: __Auto-completion experiment:__

Comparing **Scigraph** and **fast auto-complete**

We have 465142 of 1-gram and 2-grams extracted from NIFS Ontology and datasets.

```DataTest1``` (test_autocomplete_pure.json) consists of 200 words selected randomly from the n-grams. The selection criteria is:

* word with length between 3 and 15
* word does not contain number

Thereafter, we created a second dataset by changing one character in ```DataTest1``` randomly at position 2 until 15 with * , named ```DataTestWithTypo``` (test_autocomplete_typo.json).

The experiment is set to return 10 completion in maximum for each query.

:point_right: __Execution Time Analysis:__

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/Niloofar-Sh/aqua/blob/main/src/assets/images/execution_time.png" alt="interface" width="750" height="500"></br>
  <i>Fig 14. Execution time analysis.</i>
</p>

Example results plus the execution rates:

1) SciGraph + ```DataTest1``` : 0.8019 second
`
2) SciGraph + ```DataTestWithTypo```: 0.81809 second

3) fast-autocomplete + ```DataTest1``` : 0.03280 second

4) fast-autocomplete + ```DataTestWithTypo```: 0.07471 second


In general longer words will need longer execution times.

:point_right: __The number of completions:__

<p align="center">

  <i>Fig 15. Number of completions returned.</i>
</p>

1) SciGraph + ```DataTest1``` : 
 ```
 'sinonasal': [],
 'acid-oxo': [],
 'chondrichthyes': ['chondrichthyes'],
 'turbellarian': 
  ['turbellarian platyhelminths']
  ```
2) SciGraph + ```DataTestWithTypo```:

```
'sinon*sal': [],
 'acid-o*o': [],
 'chondricht*yes': [],
 'turbel*arian': []
```
3) fast-autocomplete + ```DataTest1``` : 

```
'sinonasal': ['sinonasal', 'sinonasal papilloma', 'sinonasal undifferentiated'],
'acid-oxo':['acid oxo',
   'acid oxoanion',
   'acid oxo group',
   'acid oxoacid',
   'acid oxoanions',
   'acid oxoacids',
   'acid oxoglutarate',
   'acid oxoglutarate dehydrogenase',
   'acid oxoacyl-',
   'acid oxoacyl- and'],
'chondrichthyes': ['chondrichthyes'],
'turbellarian': ['turbellarian', 'turbellarian platyhelminths']
```

4) fast-autocomplete + ```DataTestWithTypo```:

```
'sinon*sal': ['sinonasal', 'sinonasal papilloma', 'sinonasal undifferentiated'],
 'acid-o*o': ['acid',
   'acid oxidase',
   'acid oxidation',
   'acid o-linked',
   'acid omega-hydroxylase',
   'acid or',
   'acid o-methyltransferase',
   'acid oxygenase',
   'acid optimum',
   'acid oxidoreductase'],
 'chondricht*yes':  ['chondrichthyes'],
 'turbel*arian': ['turbellarian', 'turbellarian platyhelminths']
```

__SciGraph__ returns a smaller number of completions. When there is a typo, SciGraph returns *almost zero completion*.
Longer words cause a reduce in the completion number. Typo tends to increase the number of completion for __fast-autocomplete__.

:triangular_flag_on_post: __In all cases, fast-autocomplete can return results.__
